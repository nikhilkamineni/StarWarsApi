## WORK IN PROGRESS!

- Continuation of React Sprint.
- Combine AJAX requests with react-router

> take the code you have for last week's challenge and modify it so that clicking on one of the characters shows a new page with the character details. If done early, add functionality so that clicking on one of the films from the character detail page would navigate to a new page that shows the details about the film. The idea here is to practice Routing in combination with making AJAX requests. Go as deep as you can, maybe show pages for Homeworld details, for Ship details....
